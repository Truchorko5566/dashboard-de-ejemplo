[**Invite the Public Version of this Bot**](https://milrato.milrato.dev) so you don't need to host it by yourself or [join my Discord server](https://discord.gg/dcdev) to get a custom Bot hosted for you!


# Important notes and thank ‚ù§Ô∏è
First of all, thanks for using this Source Code, it was and is a ton of work to create and maintain it!
That's why I'm asking everyone to [**donate a little bit of money**](https://donate.milrato.dev) or if that's not possible, then join my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/dcdev)!

  **NOTE:** It is suggested to use the [Sharded (&Clustered) version](https://github.com/Tomato6966/Multipurpose-discord-bot/tree/sharded_with_mongo), if you plan on using it for a VERIFIED BOT (on more then 2000 Servers!)
 

# Installation Guide üî•

## ‚úÖ Hosting Requirements

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

  * [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) version 16.6 or higher, I recommend the latest STABLE version
  * [python](https://python.org) version 3.8 or higher, to install the database `enmap` (better-sqlite3)
  * A VPS would be advised, so you don't need to keep your PC/laptop/RasPi 24/7 online! [Click here for a debian setup](https://github.com/Tomato6966/Debian-Cheat-Sheet-Setup/wiki/).
  * Check out my recommended Host: [BERO-HOST](https://bero.milrato.dev) and use code `milrato` for cheap OP VPS (kvm)
  * [Click here for a Direct Order Link](https://bero-host.de/server/prepaid-kvm-rootserver-paket-mieten)
